# Inspiration

In this day and age, concerts and music streaming services are the primary sources of revenue for music artists to promote their work. Especially due to COVID-19, artists have relied on online services to earn profit and reach out to new audiences. With that said, upcoming artists find it incredibly difficult to grow their audience. The music industry is one of the most difficult industries to break into since a very small percentage of popular artists hoard the vast majority of the attention. Our goal is to create a platform that incentivizes people to pay more attention to upcoming artists. Such incentives include things like greater personal engagement with artists and greater discoverability of their music.

# What it does

Crescendo has several features promoting discoverability and engagement. The home page of the website is the discover music page, where listeners can search for new songs based on category. If they like a song, they can put it in a playlist or ‘recommend’ the song (as opposed to ‘liking’ the song) to others.

This recommendation will be posted in the Community Feed, where a message indicating the song has been recommended will pop up in both the listener’s and the artist’s feed. The Community Notes is where the artist can also post news updates and song release posts within their own created community. Artists can also manage their tracks and analytics through a private dashboard.

One major feature of Crescendo is ‘Requests’, a feature that allows artists to post musical favors in exchange for monetary support. Listeners might pay for options such as a song request or a musical Happy Birthday note. With these additional features, the engagement between listeners and artists is much stronger, and artists have greater opportunities to solidify their following.
